ReactIve Shop is my final project of the React course of Coderhouse.
I have been inspired by the market of Axion, a filling station here in Mar del Plata.
To give life to this E-Commerce I have used React.js, Firebase of Google for the data of the products and the orders and Cloudinary to store the images.
